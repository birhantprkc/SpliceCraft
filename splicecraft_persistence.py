"""splicecraft_persistence — the domain-agnostic save/load engine (layer 1).

Extracted from the splicecraft.py hub (Phase B-main). This is the persistence
*service*: atomic write + multi-generation backup rotation + lost-entries
spillover + schema-envelope parse/migrate + the read-back-validated safe save,
plus the save-authorization chokepoint that refuses writes to the real data dir
unless a sanctioned caller opted in. Domain `_save_X` / `_load_X` wrappers stay
in the hub and call this engine; they migrate to their own modules later.

Dependencies are deliberately minimal so this layer never imports the hub:
stdlib + `splicecraft_state` (paths, caches, the `_SAVES_AUTHORIZED` flag, the
backup/lost-entries tunables, the blob-dehydration hooks) + the logger. The hub
re-exports every name below (``from splicecraft_persistence import _safe_save_json
as _safe_save_json`` ...) so ``sc._safe_save_json`` and every existing call site
resolve unchanged.

SACRED (see CLAUDE.md): `_safe_save_json` always backs up (.bak + mkstemp +
fsync + os.replace), re-raises on failure, and gates on
`_state._SAVES_AUTHORIZED` via `_refuse_unauthorized_write` at its first line.
Blob dehydration is invoked through `_state._dehydrate_*_hook` (registered by the
hub) so the engine stays decoupled from the blob subsystem.

    Caught-live failure (2026-05-25 incident): switching from
    "DemoColl Parts" (26 entries) to an empty "FFE Parts" bin called
    ``_safe_save_json(_state._PARTS_BIN_FILE, [], "Parts bin")`` directly.
    The L3 catastrophic shrink guard saw 26 → 0 entries and refused
    the write — saving the user from data loss but also breaking the
    legitimate bin switch. The "old" data was NEVER at risk: the 26
    DemoColl entries live in ``parts_bin_collections.json`` under the
    "DemoColl Parts" key. The shrink guard correctly treats parts_bin.json
    as the primary store; this helper tells it explicitly that this
    particular write is a *mirror swap* — the primary is the collections
    file, the named bin's data is intact, so a 100% shrink is a
    legitimate state transition.

    Symmetric for every mirror pair:

      * `parts_bin.json`   <- `parts_bin_collections.json`     (active bin)

    Implementation: wraps `_safe_save_json` in `_expected_mirror_swap()`
    (2026-06-03). Previously it used `_allow_catastrophic_shrink()`,
    which bypassed the >90% REFUSAL but STILL spilled the "dropped"
    entries to `lost_entries/` — a redundant copy of data that already
    lives in the collections file, and for the plasmid_library mirror a
    ~150 MB write on every collection switch (the cause of the 1.5 GB
    `lost_entries/` residue). `_expected_mirror_swap()` skips that
    redundant spill too. The wrapper exists so:
    (a) callers don't have to remember the context manager pattern;
    (b) a `grep _safe_save_json_mirror` enumerates every cross-mirror
