"""End-to-end + structural guards for the extracted logging layer (Phase B).

`splicecraft_logging` (layer 0) owns the logging primitives (`_log`,
`_log_event`, `_repr_for_log`, the filters, `_SESSION_ID`, `_LOG_CTRL_RE`); the
hub keeps the `_DATA_DIR`-dependent file-handler wiring and the
`_action_log` / `_timed` decorators (whose internal `_log_event` call must
resolve the hub's patchable re-export).

The semi-silent regression this guards: the handler ends up mis-wired and
structured events stop reaching the log file -- which the rest of the suite
would NOT catch, since no other test asserts the log is actually written.
