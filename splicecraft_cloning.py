"""splicecraft_cloning — construction simulation (Phase D, layer L3).

The "simulate the real steps" construction helpers ([INV-127]): build real
amplicons (`_simulate_primed_amplicon`), assemble real cloned plasmids via
digest+ligation (`_simulate_cloned_plasmid`), the pUPD2 backbone stub, overhang
fusion, the Commercial-SaaS `.dna` history serialisation, and the **Gibson assembly
simulator** ([INV-85/86]): `_simulate_gibson_assembly` + its `_gibson_*` helpers
(overlap detect, body-length validate, product build, feature shift + origin-wrap
merge) and `_gibson_record_from_result`; plus the **traditional (restriction) cloning
simulator** ([INV-127]): the ligation primitives (`_ends_compatible`/`_ligate_fragments`
/`_close_circular`) and the cut-paste sims (`_simulate_traditional_cloning`(`_multi`),
`_classify_junction`, `_annotate_scars_on_product`, `_rc_fragment`,
`_label_disrupted_split_features`), with the fragment-prep that feeds them
(`_make_synthetic_fragment`, `_excise_pcr_insert`, `_excise_fragment_pair`,
`_enzyme_is_type_iis`); and the **Golden-Braid (BsaI Type IIS) fragment scrub**
([INV-127]): `_scrub_gb_design` + its `_scrub_gb_*` helpers + `_assemble_scrub_amplicons_real`
+ the `_SCRUB_GB_*` constants — cures sites by splitting at each cluster into BsaI-tailed
PCR fragments that Golden-Gate reassemble into the cured plasmid (real digest+ligate,
verified); and the **Golden-Braid / MoClo domestication primer designers**:
`_design_gb_primers` (single-part domestication, with internal-Type-IIS synonymous
repair) + `_design_operon_soe_primers` (whole-operon SOE) + the grammar-position /
forbidden-site / pair-name helpers (`_grammar_position_by_type`/`_position_overhangs`/
`_tu_overhangs`, `_gb_find_forbidden_hits`, `_gb_binding_region_advisory`,
`_dom_primer_pair_names`). Extracted so the cloning modal/screen siblings can import them.
Layer L3: imports state(L0), biology(L0), codon(L2), primer(L2), dataaccess(L1),
record(L1), history(L2), logging(L0); used by the modals (L4). The enzyme catalog is
reached via `_state._all_enzymes_hook` (it reads dataaccess but stays hub-side); the GB
scrub + designers reuse primer's `_scrub_design`/binding helpers + codon's `_codon_fix_*`
(all L2, downward — neither imports cloning). Re-exported by the hub so every call site
resolves unchanged.

    feature should extend upstream to include its embedded start codon.

    GB 2.0 puts the ATG start codon inside the AATG fusion overhang
    (Pos 12→13 boundary): AATG = A + ATG, where the A is the spacer
    base and ATG is the start codon. The domesticator's forward primer
    encodes AATG as the part's 5' fusion overhang and PCR-binds at
    codon 2 of the source CDS — so the L0 part's body sequence
    (`part["sequence"]`) starts at codon 2, NOT at the ATG.

    When the part is assembled into an L1 plasmid the upstream LINK
    contributes its AATG (Pos 12 oh3) which fuses with the part's
    AATG oh5; the resulting cloned sequence reads
    ``...LINK-body...A + ATG + [codon2]...`` and the ATG sits in the
    last 3 nt of the fusion overhang. A feature annotation that only
    spans [body-start, body-end) would therefore drop the user's
    start codon — visibly broken in the L1 plasmid map.

    This helper returns ``3`` when the part needs the upstream
    extension (any coding part type with ``oh5 == AATG``: Signal
    peptide, CDS, CDS-NS, CDS-NS (CT)), and ``0`` otherwise. Returning

    This is the biologically-faithful replacement for handing a PCR / feature
    insert to `_make_synthetic_fragment`, which kept the WHOLE input as the
    fragment's `top_seq` — so the GCGC primer pad + the recognition-site bases
    OUTSIDE the cut leaked into the ligated clone ("extra bases in the
    product"). At the bench those off-cuts are tiny end pieces you purify away;
    only the middle fragment carries into the ligation.

    Two input shapes, one identical result:

      * **Full PCR product** already carrying the ``[pad][site]…[site][pad]``
        primer tails — what the Clone-region (Alt+Shift+P) workflow builds, or
        a user pasting their real amplicon. A literal linear digest drops the
        flanking pad/off-cut pieces and keeps the single middle fragment.
      * **Bare region** the user amplified (no tails — the Constructor's manual
        "Paste DNA" donor). We wrap it in the SAME ``[pad][site]…[site][pad]``
        the tailed primers would add, then digest — so the purified insert is
        byte-identical to the full-product case.

    Either way NONE of the primer-added pad / outside-the-cut site bases
    survive into the fragment; the retained POST-cut site bases (which reform
    the recognition site when it ligates) DO stay, exactly as at the bench. The
    overhang sequence + kind come straight from the real cut (`_fragments_from_
    cuts`), so 5'/3'/blunt, palindromic and asymmetric cutters all land right
    and the fragment ligates against a literally-digested vector without the
    convention mismatch the synthetic model had.

    Features (amplicon-local coords) are slotted onto the insert by
    `_fragments_from_cuts`; on the wrap path they're first offset past the
    synthesised ``[pad][site]`` lead so they still land on the payload.

    Type IIS is refused (the recognition-only tail can't encode an outside
    cut — mirrors `_make_synthetic_fragment`); use 'From plasmid' literal

# ═══ Golden-Braid (BsaI Type IIS) fragment-based scrub — moved from the hub ══
# Cures sites by splitting at each cluster into BsaI-tailed PCR fragments that
# Golden-Gate reassemble into the cured plasmid (real digest+ligate, verified).
# Uses primer's _scrub_design + the now-local _ligate_fragments/_close_circular.

# ── Scrub: Golden Braid (BsaI Type IIS) fragment-based curing ───────────────
#
# An alternative re-circularization to the QuikChange path above. Instead of
# one whole-plasmid amplicon that self-anneals, the plasmid is split at each
# cure cluster into PCR fragments; each fragment's primers carry a BsaI
# (GGTCTC) 5' tail + the NATIVE 4 nt junction overhang, and a Golden Gate /
# Golden Braid (BsaI) reaction reassembles the fragments seamlessly — the
# only net change vs the original is the cured sites.
#
# Because BsaI is the ASSEMBLY enzyme, EVERY BsaI site in the plasmid (not
# just user-listed ones) must be cured — a retained BsaI site is cut
# mid-reaction and scrambles the product. That is the "an unwanted site IS
# BsaI" edge case: BsaI is force-added to the cure set, and a BsaI site that
# can't be silently removed makes the whole Golden Braid design fail (you
# can't Golden-Gate around a site the enzyme still cuts). The cure is sliced
# into the primer ends from the CURED template, so each amplicon is
# internally BsaI-clean; a digest+ligate simulation then proves the
# reassembled product equals the cured plasmid (catastrophic-class: the
# design IS the product). Primer-tail layout mirrors the Domesticator
# (PAD + GGTCTC + spacer + native binding); the binding's first 4 nt ARE the
# fusion overhang, so reassembly restores native sequence except the cures.

# with the Type IIS enzyme (BsaI / BsmBI / BbsI / SapI / Esp3I), keep each
# released body (cut on BOTH ends), then chain them by their native 4 nt
# overhangs into a circle. Unlike the scrub assembler above the parts are NOT
# pre-ordered — the overhangs alone dictate the order (the whole point of Golden
# Gate). [INV-127: the design IS the product — a real digest + ligation.]

    cures every grammar-forbidden Type IIS site, and adds the grammar's TU
    cassette to the ends — ready to clone into the grammar's entry vector.

    ``extra_enzymes`` (names, e.g. ``["EcoRI", "KpnI"]``) are cured ALONGSIDE the
    grammar's Type IIS set — resolved against the merged enzyme catalog and
    treated identically (synonymous inside CDS, flagged outside), so the lifted
    operon can be scrubbed of downstream cloning sites too, not just the
    assembly enzymes.

    The user amplifies NATIVE DNA (no synthesis), so every cure must be carried
    by a primer. Curing = synonymous substitutions inside CDS features
    (`_scrub_design`, multi-CDS, reverse-strand- and stop-safe) PLUS any
    ``manual_edits`` ({pos, to}) the user marked for non-coding sites. Edits are
    clustered (`_SCRUB_PRIMER_FOOTPRINT`); each cluster becomes an SOE junction
    with a complementary mutagenic primer pair carrying the cured bases, and the
    two outermost primers carry ``pad + site + spacer + TU-overhang + binding``.

    Returns one of:
      * ``{ok: True, cured_seq, edits, primers:[{name, seq, kind, tm, ...}],
            n_clusters, tu_overhangs, amplicon_len, warnings}``

            ``manual_edits`` for the ``in_cds=False`` ones and re-runs.
      * ``{error: str}``

    CATASTROPHIC-CLASS GATE: a cure is only real if a primer carries it. Before
    returning ``ok`` every edit position is checked to fall inside a
    primer-covered window (a flank binding region or a mutagenic window);
    otherwise PCR off the native template would silently leave that site intact,
