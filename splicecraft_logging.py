"""Logging primitives for SpliceCraft (layer 0).

Extracted from the monolith so any sibling can log. Holds the `splicecraft`
logger (`_log`), the surrogate/session filters, the structured-event emitter
`_log_event`, and `_repr_for_log`. Imports nothing from the rest of the package.

DELIBERATELY LEFT IN THE HUB (do not move here):
  * the `_DATA_DIR`-dependent file-handler wiring (`_default_log_path` /
    `_LOG_PATH` + the `RotatingFileHandler` setup) -- it reads the data dir;
    the hub configures THIS logger after importing it.
  * the `_action_log` / `_timed` decorators -- they call `_log_event`
    internally, and tests monkeypatch `sc._log_event`; keeping the decorators
    in the hub makes that call resolve the patchable re-export rather than a
    private copy here. See tests/test_logging.py.

    Output line shape (JSON payload after the prefix):

    The event payload is JSON so any downstream parser (jq, Python
    json.loads, an LLM scanning the log on the user's behalf) can
    extract every field unambiguously without regex tricks against
    embedded whitespace or quotes. `stacklevel=2` makes the
    `funcName:lineno` prefix point at the originating caller, not at
    `_log_event` itself — so even an empty-field event names the
    method that emitted it.

    Sacred invariant: every string value over 200 chars is truncated
    before encoding, so a caller that accidentally passes raw
    sequence content can't leak bases into the log file. Non-scalar
    values pass through `_repr_for_log` which truncates and adds a
    size hint.

    Use this at click handlers, key actions, save/load/annotate
    boundaries — anywhere a user-visible state change happens. The
    output goes to the rotating log file at INFO level so a user
    pasting their log into a bug report tells the reader (or an
    AI assistant) exactly what was being done when the symptom hit.

    Event-name conventions (see also CLAUDE.md invariant #43):
      * `app.<area>.<verb>`  — user actions
            e.g. `app.save.trigger`, `app.library.add`,
            `app.feature.add`, `app.click_debug.toggle`.
      * `op.<area>.<verb>`   — heavy ops emitted by `@_timed`
            e.g. `op.fetch_genbank`, `op.gibson_simulate`,
            `op.pairwise_align`, `op.blast_search`, `op.hmmscan`,
            `op.annotation_transfer`.
      * `<noun>.<verb>`      — state changes
            e.g. `save.ok` / `save.failed`, `record.loaded`,
            `undo.trigger` / `undo.refused` / `undo.empty`,
            `redo.trigger` / `redo.refused` / `redo.empty`,
            `lock.acquired` / `lock.contended` / `lock.stale` /
            `lock.released`, `shutdown.drain.ok` /
            `shutdown.drain.timeout`, `agent.write.ok` /
            `agent.write.failed`, `agent.error`.

    Performance: short-circuits to a no-op when the logger isn't
    INFO-enabled, so every callsite pays one `isEnabledFor` check
    (~100 ns) in the happy path. The `logging` machinery is
    thread-safe, so this is safe to call from `@work` workers.
