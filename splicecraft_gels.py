"""splicecraft_gels — agarose-gel simulation + render (Phase D, layer L1).

The [SUB-gels] simulation core, extracted from the hub: gel-entry normalisation
+ id minting, the agarose-mobility model, per-lane band computation, and the
text/Rich gel-image render. Pure (app-free) — operates on plain gel dicts; the
GelLibraryModal / SimulatorScreen pass them in. Depends only on lower layers:
`_digest_with_enzymes` (biology L0, for restriction-band sizing) + the util
sanitisers / `_now_iso`. Re-exported by the hub so `sc.<name>` + every existing
call site (modals, agent gel endpoints) resolves unchanged.
