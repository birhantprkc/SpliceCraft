"""splicecraft_record — GenBank <-> SeqRecord serialization (Phase D, layer L1).

The hub's record serialization core, extracted so the modal/screen siblings that
parse/serialise records can import it instead of calling it bare on the hub. This
is MISSION-CRITICAL (INV-98: the GenBank LOCUS must never carry the human/display
name; the .dna + library round-trips depend on byte-faithful parse/serialise), so
it moved as one self-contained unit with its own LRU parse cache. Biopython is
imported lazily inside the two entry points (`from Bio import SeqIO`) exactly as
in the hub. The SpliceCraft version stamped into the GenBank COMMENT is read from
`_state._sc_version` (the hub sets it from `__version__`, which must stay in
splicecraft.py for release.py's bump regex). Re-exported by the hub so `sc.<name>`
+ every existing call site resolves unchanged.

    rejoins the continuation line with a SPACE (the right thing for free-text
    ``/note``, the wrong thing for a sequence). So any primer longer than the
