"""splicecraft_backup — user-data backup / restore / migrate engine (Phase D, layer L1).

The whole-data-directory lifecycle operations, extracted from the hub so the
data-safety machinery is one bounded, testable unit:

  * Daily launch-time snapshots (`_snapshot_data_files` / `_prune_old_snapshots`)
    + data-dir housekeeping (`_run_data_dir_housekeeping`).
  * The user-data file/dir REGISTRIES (`_USER_DATA_FILE_ATTRS` / `_USER_DATA_DIR_ATTRS`
    / `_OPERATIONAL_FILE_ATTRS`) — the canonical "what is user data" definition that
    backup, Master Delete, and migrate-archive all drive from.
  * Master Delete TARGET ENUMERATION (`_master_delete_*_targets` / `_residual_paths`
    / `_log_files`) — the pure "which paths are user data" lists; the actual
    app-coupled wipe (`_perform_master_delete`) stays hub-side.
  * Pre-update snapshots for `splicecraft update` rollback (`_create_pre_update_snapshot`
    / `_list_pre_update_snapshots` / `_validate_snapshot_member`
    / `_restore_pre_update_snapshot` / `_enforce_pre_update_retention`
    + `_resolve_pre_update_backup_dir`).
  * Migrate-archive export/import for moving data between machines
    (`_export_migrate_archive` / `_import_migrate_archive`).

SACRED: every write goes through persistence's atomic-write + chokepoint
(`_atomic_write_*` re-exported from L0). Two hub-pinned bits are reached through
`_state` hooks (no upward import, behaviour-identical): `_resolve_data_attr_hook`
(the hub's `_resolve_state_or_hub`, whose `globals()` fallback must run hub-side)
and `_gc_orphan_blobs_hook` (the blob store stays hub-side). Re-exported by the
hub so `sc.<name>` + every call site resolves unchanged.

Imports only L0 siblings (persistence / util / logging / state) → layer L1.

# Belt-and-braces above `_safe_save_json`'s rotating backups: on every
# new calendar day the user starts the app, we copy each persistent
# JSON file to `<DATA_DIR>/snapshots/<file>-YYYY-MM-DD.json`. That way a
# bad upgrade or worker race that writes empty data over the weekend can
# always be reverted from a known-good snapshot up to a month old.
#
# Snapshots are pruned once they're older than `_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS`
# (30) so the directory doesn't grow without bound. Per-file size is
# tiny (~100 KB typical library), so 30 days × 4 files ≈ 12 MB at most.
#
# Files snapshotted: plasmid library, collections, parts bin, primers.
# (.dna sidecars and feature library are deliberately excluded — the
# former is byte-identical to the user's source files, the latter is
