"""splicecraft_fileio — single-file sequence-format I/O (Phase D, layer L2).

The plain file-format read/write core, extracted from the hub: FASTA / AB1 /
FASTQ / GFF3 ingest (path -> SeqRecord) + GenBank / GFF / FASTA / EMBL export
(record -> path), with their codec helpers. Biopython is imported lazily inside
the entry points exactly as in the hub. fileio now owns the WHOLE file + network
I/O layer: the .dna CommercialSaaS codec, the _save/_load/_delete_dna_original
blob store, the NCBI fetch_genbank / fetch_protein fetchers, and the zip /
Plasmidsaurus handling were all migrated here from the hub (data-safety
preserved — blob writes go through the persistence chokepoint, and NCBI fetch
reaches the egress guard via _state._demo_block_network_hook). Re-exported by the
hub so `sc.<name>` + every call site (modals, agent endpoints, the loader)
resolves unchanged.

# Pure byte<->record codec for the SnapGene-style .dna binary format: the
# packet TLV reader/writer, history-XML extract/pack/inject, the from-scratch
# .dna emit (cookie/dna/features/notes packets), and the augment-from-packets
# recovery path. No data-dir writes, no network (the blob store, the loader,
# and fetch_genbank stay hub-side). Lazy struct/lzma/xml.etree/primer3 inside
# the fns exactly as in the hub.
# ── .dna packet I/O (low-level) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Binary format: each packet is a TLV — 1-byte type + 4-byte
# big-endian length + N bytes payload. The cookie packet (0x09)
# MUST come first; everything after is in implementation order.
# BioPython parses ~5 packet types (cookie, dna, primers, notes,
# features); the rest are silently dropped on read and impossible
# to write at all (BioPython has no .dna writer).
#
# These helpers go below the BioPython layer: they walk the raw
# byte stream, surface every packet (known or not), and let us
# round-trip files by splicing modified packets back into the
# original byte stream — preserving every packet we don't yet
# understand. Packet-type catalog (in progress) lives in

# ── zip / Plasmidsaurus member handling (Phase D, moved from hub) ───────────
# [SUB-plasmidsaurus] zip member safety (path-traversal + size caps) + the
# Plasmidsaurus run-zip / per-base-TSV parsers + gbk display-label helper. The
# members are returned as text/metadata; the CALLER parses records (no
# load_genbank dependency here). Lazy zipfile/stat/codecs/re inside the fns.
# ── Sequencing-data ingestion (Plasmidsaurus etc.) ────────────────────────────
#
# Plasmidsaurus delivers each run as a .zip with per-sample directories
# containing a consensus assembly (`*.gbk` / `*.gb`), raw reads, and
# QC plots. SpliceCraft's first-pass workflow:
#
#   1. User picks the .zip via `PlasmidsaurusZipModal` (file browser).
#   2. We list every `.gbk` / `.gb` member inside (size-capped to keep
#      the picker responsive against absurd zips).
#   3. User picks a member; we `_extract_gbk_member` it into memory and
#      parse via `_gb_text_to_record`.
#   4. User picks a target plasmid from the library — we run a
#      `_pairwise_align` between the two sequences and surface the
#      result on `AlignmentScreen`.
#
# Future: a Plasmidsaurus API key + per-account download lands here as
# a network sibling of the zip path. Same downstream alignment +
# visualisation pipeline.

# Per-zip + per-member size caps. Plasmidsaurus zips for a single run

# larger is suspicious; refuse rather than OOM the picker.

# ── Plasmidsaurus run-zip structured parser ───────────────────────────────────
#
# A standard Plasmidsaurus results zip groups files by category and
# names each by `<run>_<sample-idx>_<sample-name>.<ext>`. Categories
# seen in the wild:
#
#   <run>_genbank-files/<base>.gbk          — annotated consensus
#   <run>_fasta-files/<base>.fasta          — bare consensus FASTA
#   <run>_summary-files/<base>.txt          — k-mer % + contamination %
#   <run>_per-base-data/<base>.tsv          — per-bp coverage / quality
#   <run>_histograms/<base>.png             — read-length histogram
#   <run>_coverage-plots/<base>.png         — coverage plot
#   <run>_interactive-map/<base>.html       — Bokeh interactive map
#   <run>_ab1-files/<base>.<n-of-m>.ab1     — Sanger trace
#   <run>_gel.png                            — run-level virtual gel
#
# The `_parse_plasmidsaurus_zip` walk groups every member under its
# sample's canonical base name, surfaces run-level files separately,
# and returns small dicts the Sequencing toolbar's sub-tabs can render
# without re-reading the zip per tab. The summary-file body and the
# per-base TSV header are streamed inline (both tiny — <500 KB) so
# the QC tab can render contamination / coverage stats without a
# second pass.

# Cap on the inline-cached summary-file text we keep on the SequencingScreen
# instance. Per the Plasmidsaurus summary files inspected (≤200 bytes
# typical), 4 KB is generous; refuse anything larger to keep the
# in-memory cache bounded even on malformed runs.
_PLASMIDSAURUS_SUMMARY_MAX_BYTES = 4 * 1024

# Cap on per-base TSV reads. Real Plasmidsaurus per-base data is
# ~50 bytes/row × plasmid bp (so a 10 kbp plasmid ships ~500 KB).
# 100 MB is generous for the largest plasmids we'd ever see (200 kbp
# ≈ 10 MB) while still bounding a hostile zip that claims a tiny
# `file_size` in the central directory but streams unbounded data on
# decompress. Sacred-invariant defence-in-depth: also enforced inside
# `_summarize_perbase_tsv` via a chunked read so a single bombing
# line without newlines can't OOM `io.TextIOWrapper`'s buffer.
