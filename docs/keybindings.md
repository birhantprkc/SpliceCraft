## Terminal-specific notes

The Ctrl/Shift/Alt key namespace is heavily intercepted by terminal
emulators. The current keymap was chosen to avoid common collisions
(see the 0.5.5.x churn in `CHANGELOG.md` for the history). If a
binding doesn't reach the app:

- **`Ctrl+Shift`+letter (and `Ctrl+I` / `Ctrl+H`) don't work on most
  terminals.** Without the Kitty keyboard protocol (VTE / Ptyxis, macOS
  Terminal, basic xterm), `Ctrl+Shift`+letter collapses to plain
  `Ctrl`+letter, and `Ctrl+I` / `Ctrl+H` arrive as Tab / Backspace. So
  every action uses a terminal-safe primary — `Alt+K` add-to-library,
  plain `c` clear-marks, `Alt+I` attach-image (Experiments), `Ctrl+Y`
  redo, `F6` history, `Alt+C` bottom-strand copy — with the old combos
  kept as aliases where the terminal reports them.
- `Alt+M` toggles **click-debug mode**: every keystroke + click is
  reported as a toast with the modifier set that actually arrived at
  the app. Use this to identify what the terminal swallowed.
- For Shift+click terminals where Shift is consumed by selection,
  Ctrl+click is registered as a Shift+click synonym.
- For Alt+combo terminals that send `Esc + key`, the app accepts
  both `Alt+X` and `Esc X`.

See `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` for the per-terminal smoke matrix the
maintainer runs before each release.

## Menus

The top bar has 16 menus, left to right. All but **File** open their tool
directly (no dropdown). Press `Ctrl+K` for a fuzzy command palette that reaches
every one by name. Most menus also have an `Alt`+letter (shown in `?` Help).
