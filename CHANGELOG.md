## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Feature deletion** — press `Delete` to remove the selected feature (annotation only,
  sequence is untouched); fully undo/redo-able with `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z`.

- **Toggleable linear map view** — press `v` to switch the circular map panel between
  circular and horizontal linear views.  Linear view uses the same braille-pixel rendering
  with per-strand feature bars, arrowheads, lane stacking, and feature labels.

- **Strand-aware DNA sequence panel layout** — forward-strand features always appear
  *above* the DNA sequence line; reverse-strand features always appear *below*, making
  strand identity immediately apparent.  Overlapping features on the same strand stack
  into additional lanes on their respective side.

- **Braille feature bars in sequence panel** — annotation bars now use solid braille
  block characters (`⣿`) matching the aesthetic of the map viewer, with `▶`/`◀`
  arrowheads at the true start/end of each feature.

- **Single-bp feature triangles** — features that are one base-pair wide render as `▼`
  (above DNA) or `▲` (below DNA), pointing inward toward the sequence line.

- **Label-above / label-below layout** — feature names appear outside the bar (above the
  bar for forward features, below for reverse), keeping the braille bar itself clean.
  Multiple non-overlapping features share a single horizontal row pair.

- **Feature connector lines** (`l` key toggle) — draws a `┊` connector between each
  feature label and its braille bar in the sequence panel, and a dotted radial leader
  line from the arc to the label in the circular map.  Both panels respond to the same
  toggle.

- **Circular map: inside tick marks** — bp graduation marks and labels now sit *inside*
  the backbone ring rather than outside, keeping the outer ring clean for feature labels.
  Two constants (`TICK_DR_MARK`, `TICK_DR_LABEL`) control the inset depth and scale
  automatically with the `,` / `.` aspect-ratio keys.

- **Circular map: full-length feature labels** — removed the 16-character truncation;
  labels now display their full name.

- **Circular map: proximity label placement** — labels are placed as close to the arc as
  possible, greedy-stepping radially outward only when a label would overlap an
  already-placed one.  `LABEL_DR_MIN` (default `9`) sets the minimum clearance.

- **Default library entry** — MW463917.1 (pACYC184) is fetched and added to the library
  automatically on first launch.  The NCBI fetch dialog pre-fills with this accession.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-23

### Added

- Initial release: braille-canvas circular plasmid map, NCBI live fetch, local `.gb`
  file loading, persistent plasmid library, feature sidebar with CDS translation,
  sequence panel with click-to-cursor, drag selection, undo/redo, and restriction-site
  overlay.
- ASCII logo and README.
