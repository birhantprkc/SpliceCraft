# ── XML-security parse primitive (relocated from hub, [PIT-19]) ──────────────
# Pure stdlib (lazy io + xml.etree). Defangs billion-laughs / XXE / deep-nesting.

def _safe_xml_parse(xml_data: str, *, allow_dtd: bool = False):
    """Parse XML with defense against billion-laughs / XXE tricks.

    Python's stdlib ET (expat) already refuses to fetch external entities
    since 3.7.1, so the remaining attack surface is DTD-declared entity
    expansion. Pre-fix we substring-matched `<!doctype` / `<!entity` only
    in the FIRST 4096 chars — exploitable with a long whitespace /
    comment prefix that pushes the DOCTYPE past the window.

    Replaced with a streaming prologue scan: skip leading whitespace +
    comments + processing instructions and inspect the first non-trivial
    declaration. If it's a DOCTYPE / ENTITY, refuse before handing to
    expat. NCBI / Kazusa / .dna history XML have no legitimate DTD, so
    this never false-positives.

    ``allow_dtd=True`` opts a caller into permitting an **external** DTD
    reference — e.g. NCBI BLAST's ``FORMAT_TYPE=XML`` output, which opens
    with ``<!DOCTYPE BlastOutput PUBLIC ... NCBI_BlastOutput.dtd>``. A
    standalone ``<!ENTITY>`` and any DOCTYPE carrying an internal subset
    (``[ … ]`` — where billion-laughs entity definitions live) are still
    refused. expat never fetches the external DTD (no network since
    3.7.1) and there are no entities to expand, so this stays XXE-safe.
    Default ``False`` keeps every existing caller's strict behaviour.
