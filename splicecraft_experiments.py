"""splicecraft_experiments — experiment-entry processing (Phase D, layer L1).

The [SUB-experiments] lab-notebook entry pipeline, extracted from the hub:
entry normalisation + id minting/sanitising, the `@plasmid` / `!action` / `&gel`
cross-reference extractors, and the legacy-tag-format migration. Pure (app-free)
— operates on plain experiment dicts / body markdown. The data-safety pieces
(`_save_experiment_image` blob write, `_delete_experiment_attach_dir` filesystem
delete) stay hub-side; `_migrate_legacy_tag_format` is re-exported because the
hub-side body-readers + the `_state._migrate_experiment_body_hook` registration
also call it. Depends only on util (L0). Re-exported by the hub so `sc.<name>` +
every existing call site (modals, agent endpoints, notes rendering) resolves
unchanged.

# Plasmid cross-reference token: `@<id>` inline anywhere in the body.

# just the tag id without the noisy `@plasmid:` prefix. The negative
# lookbehind rejects matches where `@` is preceded by a word char
# (avoids email-like patterns: `user@example.com` doesn't tag
# `example.com`). The first id char must be a letter so numeric
# prose like "rev 2 @ 5pm" doesn't trigger.
#
# Sweep #9 (2026-05-19) atomic-group pattern (`(?=(...))\1`):
# the id captures inside a lookahead THEN is consumed via the
# `\1` backreference, which prevents backtracking — without this
# trick the trailing `(?![;=])` reject would just shorten the
# match (e.g. `&amp;` would match `&am`). With it, any id
# followed by `;` or `=` is rejected ENTIRELY (HTML entities
# `&amp;`/`&nbsp;`/`&copy;`, URL params `?foo=bar`). Python 3.10
# lacks possessive quantifiers (`{0,63}+`) and atomic groups
# (`(?>...)`) so the lookahead+backref idiom is the portable
# stand-in. The captured id is still `m.group(1)` and the full
